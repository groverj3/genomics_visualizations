# Author: Jeffrey Grover
# Purpose: Create ridge plots using the ggridges package
# Created: 2019-04-19
# Usage: Ridge plots are a nice visualization for data that allows you to not
# see the same data a violin or box plot would show, but also the shape of the
# data. It doesn't suffer from the artificially inflated median-look of the
# violin plot, and turning it horizontal by default focuses the eye on the fact
# that the density is highest near the median, rather than on the extremes.

# ggridges is not a part of the tidyverse libraries, it is a separate package
# that must be installed and loaded. While, dplyr and ggplot2 will work by import
# of library(tidyverse).

# In this example, "data" is a data frame or tibble in long format with variables
# (columns) "sample" and "expression"
